                Howdy! My name is Aidan and I’m a senior at western technical commercial school. I was born in Italy and I am Italian and Sri Lankan, though I've lived in Toronto practically my whole life. Next year I plan on going to Halifax for ocean studies. I initially joined this school for the robotics and engineering SHSM because what 13 year old doesn’t like robots, but my passions drifted over time. Now I’m mostly interested in music (I'm in a band called Just July!), the outdoors, and I guess just arts in general. While not entirely interested in pusuing anything to do with computers in the future, I’m very excited to experience this course as it seems to have a lot more effort put into it, in both course work and class experience as a whole.

                In the past I’ve done some pretty simple base level coding in Python and Java but I find that I mostly excel in more hardware based applications. I have been taking tech courses since 9th grade, most recently ICS3U last year. A lot of my more diverse work was done in grade ten in TEJ2O1 which covered everything from electrical circuits to some Tetrix and arduino work. I also do some very low level linux stuff at home (server hosting, running my record player through my computer sound system, etc.), and I build all of my family’s computers. In regards to tech work that I’ve done outside of school, it is pretty minimal. I also work on vehicles if they need repair whether it be my car or quad, but that doesn’t especially apply to this course at all.
